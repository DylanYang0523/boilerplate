## Tweet search demo 🤘🏻

In this demo, we use [twitter_scrape](https://github.com/artenepo/twitter_scrape) to get the tweets data. You probably need to install [Allow-Control-Allow-Origin: *](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi?hl=en) to help you fetching the data. There are two different API calls in this demo [Search by Hashtag](https://localhost:3000/search?tab=hashtag) and [Search by User](https://localhost:3000/search?tab=user). 

You can start your react front-end trip from `/src/client/view/index.jsx`. The folder structure is a reference from [this article](https://medium.com/@alexmngn/how-to-better-organize-your-react-applications-2fd3ea1920f1).

Hope you will like it. Enjoy!
